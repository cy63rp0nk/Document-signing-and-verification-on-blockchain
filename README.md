Copy contracts from contracts folder and use 

## `https://remix.ethereum.org/`

to compile and deploy contracts onto chain (Ganache)

Copy addresses at which contract has been deployed and update 

## `doc-signing-and-verification/src/utils/contract1.js`
and
## `doc-signing-and-verification/src/utils/contract2.js` 

This sets up the required backend profile

Follow steps in 
# `doc-signing-and-verification/README.md` 
for frontend implementation
